## Sorting Algorithm Visualizer ##

Designed and implemented an interactive web-based sorting algorithm visualization tool that provides step-by-step visual demonstrations of various sorting algorithms, helping users understand the mechanics behind common sorting techniques.

## Technologies Used ##

* Frontend: React.js with functional components and hooks for state management
* State Management: Custom tracing system to capture and replay algorithm steps
* Styling: CSS with dynamic color coding to highlight algorithm operations
* Animation: Custom animation framework for smooth transitions between sorting states
* Deployment: CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions and Vercel
Key Features
* Interactive visualizations of multiple sorting algorithms:
    * Bubble Sort
    * Heap Sort
    * Merge Sort
    * Quick Sort
    * Insertion Sort
* Dynamic color-coding system to highlight comparisons, swaps, and sorted elements
* Speed control to adjust visualization pace
* Array size customization to test algorithm performance with different inputs
* Step-by-step execution with the ability to pause, resume, and reset
